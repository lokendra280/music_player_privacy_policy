    <h1>Privacy Policy for MusicPlayer</h1>

    <p>MusicPlayer ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our offline music player application ("App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our App primarily functions offline and does not collect any personal information, such as names, email addresses, or contact details. However, we may access certain data on your device to provide core functionalities of the App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Files:</strong> The App accesses the audio files stored locally on your device in order to play music. We do not transmit, store, or share these files with any external servers or third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Storage:</strong> The App requires access to your device's storage to display, organize, and play the music files stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data (Optional):</strong> If you have given explicit permission, we may collect anonymous usage statistics, such as how often the App is used, through locally stored logs. This data is solely for the purpose of improving the user experience and is not shared with any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The data we access on your device is solely used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To identify and play audio files stored on your device.</li>
        <li>To store your preferences within the App, such as favorite tracks or playlists.</li>
        <li>To enhance and improve the functionality of the App based on your interaction (e.g., save user preferences like theme selection, playback settings, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Since this is an offline app, no user data is transmitted to external servers. All music files and settings are stored locally on your device. We take reasonable measures to safeguard your data and prevent unauthorized access or disclosure. However, please note that the security of your data also depends on how secure your device is.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App does not integrate with third-party services (e.g., analytics, advertising networks, or social media). Therefore, no data is shared with third parties unless you explicitly connect your app to such services (for instance, optional cloud backup features).</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>In order for the App to function, we may ask for the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> To allow the App to read and play music files stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Media Access:</strong> To retrieve audio files and manage playback.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Internet Permission:</strong> If future features are added that require updates or cloud services, the App may request access to the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and/or on our website, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you consent to this Privacy Policy and the collection, use, and storage of your data as described herein.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the use of your data, feel free to contact us at:</p>
